This is one of my school project which I Made in my class 10



I know this is very basic but at that time it was very diificult for me to make it.

Now in the year 2022 I can make the same project with more readable and less use of same code.

More better code can be written for this basic website in very less lines.


I can now also use ReactJs or NextJs to build the same website which will be more better and efficient than this.


But I need to keep everything raw that how I started my journey, so sharing this website.

Thank You
